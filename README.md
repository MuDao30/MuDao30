- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MuDao30
Today is 2024.11.21. I'm a normal sophomore major in Computer Science in USTC.
This is my personal account in Github. The reason that I create this account is to keep tracking my own study in the university, meanwhile, I'm trying to use Github as a platform to learn about various CS projects.
I will also upload what I've done during my study. There are lots of experiments in our school, but some of the instructions are not clear, making them time-consuming.
Some of my codes may seem "wild" and "primitive", however, they may become references for junior students to know what they need to do.
I sincerely hope what I've uploaded can help them.

Attention: The codes are only references. Plagiarism is not permitted.
